## Sample Scenarios

### Request a single Certificate for a Learner with a Standard

#### 1.   (Optional) Check if certificate exists

```http
GET /ap1/v1/certificate/{uln}/{familyName}/{standard}
```

returns status code

- 204 if certificate can be created
- 200 plus certificate details, if certificate already created.
  * if EPAO was not the originator of the certificate request then limited data will be provided
  * certificate may be in 'draft', 'ready' or 'submitted' status
  * if in 'draft' status then response will include validation of data fields that are missing or incorrect

#### 2.   To request a certificate when no certificate found at step 1, or skipped step 1

```http
POST /api/v1/certificate
```

application/json body posted should contain an array for the requested certificate

```json
[{
	"requestId" : "string",
	"standard": {
		"standardCode": 0,
		"standardReference": "string"
	},
	"learner": {
		"uln": 0,
		"familyName": "string"
	},
	"learningDetails": {
		"courseOption": "string",
		"overallGrade": "Pass | Credit | Merit | Distinction | Pass with excellence | No grade awarded",

#### 3.   To submit a certificate created at step 2
Certificate can only be submitted after all validation checks have been performed, and the certificate is 'ready'
  
```http
POST /api/v1/certificate/submit
```
  
application/json body posted should contain an array of submitted certificates, each with your own unique "requestId" which will be used in the response body

```json  
[{
	"requestId" : "string",
	"uln": 0,
	"standardCode": 0,
	"standardReference": "string",
	"familyName": "string",
